Some Background
===============

In 2006 Marketing "guru" (that's my term; he'll deny it) and storyteller [Chris Brogan](https://www.chrisbrogan.com) began the practice of selecting three words guide one's actions, goals, and choices through the just-beginning new year. He publishes his selections every January 1st. Since then, many others have taken up the practice, including me.

I'm not even going to bother going over the words I used in 2020&mdash;we all know that fell along the wayside like so much discarded trash with the coronavirus completely redefined life as we know it back in March. I also can't find my original post with all the web changes I've done through the year, so there's also that complication. At some point I'll make a decision to stick to ONE place for everything, and actually _stick to that decision._ 

So, let's get to what I'm doing in 2021, shall we?

"Creating"
==========

COVID-19 redefined how we attend shows, purchase and listen to our music, view art, everything. As a result of having to put it all online, it's also somewhat _democratized_ and leveled the playing field for _independent_ and up-and-coming artists because we now have access to the same tools the "big guys" have. 

Also, working from home full-time means there's just that much more time for personal creation that used to have to be spent on rush-hour commutes, and after-hours traveling time is mostly replaced by the WebEx or Zoom meeting.

That means there's time to _create_ again, whether it's getting back into my own [music](https://soundcloud.com/inmysilence) or into my videos and vlogging again. 

[Don't F*ck with the] "Magic"
=============================

...As in a saying I picked up from a group of friends I used to hang out at Disneyland with before I moved to Florida: "Don't f*ck with the magic." With all the bad news and violence (verbal and physical) from our election process in 2020, COVID, economic woes, it's my goal this year to focus on the _positive_, the _beautiful_, and the _magic_ that the world around us and life has to offer. 

"Today"
=======

I'm a horrific procrastinator, especially when it comes to things that require interacting with other human beings (thank you, severe social anxiety). Signing up with Facebook Dating and putting more of myself out there _online_ has helped me gain some confidence, but there's still a long way to go if I no longer want to stay a single widower. I'm praying that this year I find my muse again. I also need to stop procrastinating, without going _too_ quickly and being interruptive (another bad conversation habit of mine).

Summing it up
=============
As usual, my three words always seem to form a phrase or sentence every year:

<p align="center"><strong>Creating. Magic. Today.</strong></p>

What's yours?
