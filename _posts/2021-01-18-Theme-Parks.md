[Disneyland](https://disneyland.com) Resort announced yesterday that as of January 14th, its Annual Passholder program is officially cancelled in its current form and that current passholders would get prorated refunds of their passes. Their announcement indicated a new "membership" program would be established once their parks are allowed to reopen. The move is a result of their California theme parks being shuttered for the past ten months due to the COVID epidemic and California's draconian "lockdown" rules.

The Tokyo Disneyland property made a similar announcement several months ago by ending its regular Annual Pass lottery. 

While [Walt Disney World](https://www.waltdisneyworld.com) suspended sales of _new_ Annual Passes online since they reopened back in June/July and gave current passholders the opportunity to cancel their passes and monthly payment contracts back in July and August, they are continuing to allow existing passes to be renewed (except for _Platinum Plus_ holders, who are being forced to renew at the _Platinum_ tier due to the closure of Disney's Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach water parks and ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex, which are normally included at the _Platinum Plus_ tier). Word did get out, however, that for those who opted to cancel their passes in August or had passes that expired during the COVID-related closures, Guest Relations is allowing those guests to sign up for new passes by either paying in full over the phone or by signing a Florida Resident payment contract in person at Guest Relations locations inside the resort.

## What are the Florida theme parks doing post-COVID?

Nearly all of the Florida theme parks reopened to visitors between May and July of last year, with new protocols in place such as temperature screenings, face covering requirements, and social distancing markers in ride queues to enforce the "six foot rule" throughout their properties. The notes below are from my own first-hand experience since they reopened.

### Universal Orlando Resort

[Universal Orlando Resort](https://universalorlando.com) was the first to reopen and has been setting the example for theme park operations during the pandemic.

- Temperature check areas are set up at the point where guests walk out of the parking garages and before crossing the bridge to the security checkpoint. Guests with a temperature reading over 100.4&deg; and their accompanying travel parties are refused entry into the resort.

- All entertainment and shows were initially closed, but they have been slowly reopening their shows as they have been able to establish sanitation protocols and socially-distanced seating plans. The nightclubs in CityWalk remain closed unless they provide restaurant service, in which case only the restaurant portion is open.

- Social distancing markers are placed on the ground in ride queues, shops, and other vending stations where people are likely to congregate or wait in line, to ensure all parties are at least six feet apart from any other party in the line, including across switchbacks and pre-show holding areas. 

- Most rides are being boarded only on every other row unless they are able to set up barriers between the boarding rows both for those guests waiting to board and/or on the ride itself. Rides like "Skull Island: Reign of Kong" and "Fast & Furious: Supercharged" have transparent barriers between rows on board. Eventually they started loading coasters in every row during peak periods for popular rides but set up a staggered standing arrangement for guests waiting to board (one row waits at the entry gate, next row waits at a marker six feet back from their entry gate, and alternates as such for the rest of the platform).

- Only one travel party per ride row or vehicle, with no mixing of people from different travel groups. Single riders get their own row or vehicle by themselves instead of being forced to fill in empty space. Single rider lines are closed as a result.

- Masks are required throughout the resort, including while riding attractions and watching shows. The face covering has to cover nose and mouth and be properly secured by ear loops or around the head. Guests who fail or refuse to comply are ejected from resort property.

- Team Members ("TMs" for short) provide a spritz of hand sanitizer to every guest prior to boarding any ride attraction. You don't accept, you don't ride. Sanitizer stations are also installed at all attraction exists and at other points throughout the property, including all restaurant entrances (you don't use, you don't enter).

- On rides that use 3D goggles, the goggles are individually cleaned and sanitized between uses.

- Children's common play areas have been closed.

- Restaurants and such are open with reduced seating capacities, and guests are encouraged to place their orders in the theme park app before arriving. TMs will help you use the app to order if you didn't do so beforehand or need to pay with cash. In any event, you will not be seated without an order. (This means that every restaurant is now table service, including ones that are normally quick- or self-serve).

- Speaking of cash, credit/debit and contactless payment forms like tap-to-pay are _strongly_ preferred (but they will still accept cash).

Universal also changed the format of its seasonal events since reopening. 

- Halloween Horror Nights was cancelled for the first time in its history, but in its place they set up a pair of haunted houses for guests to go through during the day and included them with regular park admission. 

- Instead of hosting the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Baloon parade during Christmas, they set up an stationary area for guests to see the baloons up close. 

- This year's Mardi Gras celebration has been changed from a nightly street party to a foodie-style event. (Incidentally, the theme parks were forced to close during the last weekend of Universal's 2020 Mardi Gras; the last two concerts were cancelled.)

- Universal did not host a New Year's Eve party this time around, instead closing the parks at 10 PM and CityWalk at midnight with no dedicated event.

- Reduced capacity in the parks caps attendance at around 30% of normal. Reservations are not required to visit. Closures due to capacity are announced on the resort's Twitter feed or in the resort app (park hours are replaced by "Closed due to Capacity" or "At Capacity") with stand-by lines for entry or re-entry as people leave. The Twitter feed usually indicates if they expect to be able to reopen later in the day. Some ride lines, night show viewing areas, and virtual queues may also be temporarily closed for capacity reasons.

- While character encounters continue, they are done at a distance (think about taking a selfie with your favorite costumed character(s) on a platform six feet behind you photobombing your selfie).

### Busch Gardens Tampa Bay & SeaWorld Orlando

These two theme parks are both owned by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment and have established mostly the same protocols as the other parks, but with lax enforcement due to reduced staff.

- Temperature check tents are set up before the ticket windows and security checkpoints, but they use a thermal camera to view people _en masse_ as they pass through rather than individual temperature screening.

- Large jugs of hand sanitizer have been placed throughout the parks and at the entrance of every ride and facility, but their use is not required or enforced. 

- Like Universal, face covering rules are in effect, with similar penalties for non-compliance; but during the times I've been in both parks it has been common to see guests not complying with face covering rules and no staff in the area to enforce the rules (or not enforcing them when they _are_ present).

- _All_ shows and entertainment have been shuttered, except for SeaWorld's animal shows (with properly spaced seating arrangements).

- Rides are generally loaded every other row, with no mixing of travel parties and single riders given a row or vehicle to themselves.

- Busch Gardens shuttered at least half of its food and drink vendors because of reduced demand, making getting a quick bite or drink a bit of a challenge.

- Reduced guest capacity is enforced using an online reservation system, requiring the purchase of a ticket or pass before making a reservation (the reservation requires the barcode from the pass or ticket). Walk-up reservations can almost always be made, however (New Year's Eve was perhaps the only time walk-ups could not be accepted).

- Unlike Universal and Disney World, which shut their parks early on New Year's Eve, Busch Gardens and SeaWorld did host New Year's Eve fireworks and stayed open until at or beyond midnight. Busch Gardens required a separate paid reservation to see the fireworks up close, while SeaWorld has a central lagoon that makes such a requirement moot.

- Rides are routinely shut down to guests briefly about every hour or two to be sprayed down with sanitizing cleaner and then run through the courses empty to dry off. 

### Walt Disney World

As I allowed my Platinum Pass to expire during the COVID shutdown, cancelled my renewal, and then new AP sales were suspended, I have not been to WDW since their reopening to observe their protocols. All the theme parks in general follow the same rules in terms of queue spacing, face covering requirements, and cleaning protocols. Disney also tends to be the strictest when it comes to enforcing such rules. 

## The most significant changes...

The most significant changes that have been common to the Florida theme parks are operating hours. They have been drastically cut due to reduced staffing and reduced guest capacity and attendance, even during peak periods. The SeaWorld P&E parks are now closing entirely one day per week during the off-season.  When the parks are open, closing times are as early as 5:00 PM on weekdays and rarely beyond 9:00 or 10:00 PM on weekends even during peak seasons.

The impacts of these changes have been felt most by passholders at the multi-property resorts (Universal and WDW), because their higher-tier Annual and multi-park Passes include properties in these resorts that are now closed or have had their hours, services, and privileges reduced. 

- Both Universal and WDW closed their water parks, which are usually open year-round, for the season in November, with the expectation of reopening in the spring. As a result, Disney's Platinum Plus tier passholders and Universal's three-park Passholders were given partial refunds on their passes; and, come renewal time, Platinum Plus passholders are forced to renew as Platinum passholders (without water park or sports complex (including golf) access) and Universal's three-park passholders have to renew as two-park passholders. (SeaWorld has kept its Aquatica park open, and Busch Gardens' Adventure Island water park was already operating seasonally before the outbreak.)

- Universal's Premiere Pass includes Express Line privileges after 4 PM, but during the week the parks may close as early as only an hour later. In response, Universal updated its Express Line privileges to begin at 2 PM during the week when the parks close early, so Premiere Passholders are provided at least four hours at the end of an operating day to use their privileges as intended (when one park closes at 5, the other park usually closes an hour later at 6 PM).  Disney World did the same thing with its "Epcot After 4" pass on days where Epcot now closes at 7 PM instead of 9:00 (moving the access time up to 2 PM on such days).

- Universal Premiere Passholders perhaps have lost the most comparatively in terms of perks due to the COVID outbreak, including loss of valet parking access (all valet parking was suspended), loss of their free single ticket for Halloween Horror Nights (due to the event being cancelled), and loss of free cover at CityWalk nightclubs (with the nightclubs closed). To Universal's credit, they have made efforts to "make it up" to passholders by providing free guest tickets (in lieu of Halloween Horror Nights), additional early park entry on select dates for lower-tier passholders, and the aforementioned changes to Express Line privileges for Premiere passholders.  The TMs have also lately gone out of their way to thank their passholders as we flash our cards for discounts or Premiere's express access.

- Busch Gardens made an effort at making its passholders happy by recently hosting a pair of passholder appreciation nights, allowing passholders to stay in the park for a few hours after official closing time to ride the coasters with almost no wait time and pin trade in one of their shops. The first of those nights I attended and it felt like I  had the entire park to myself. But it was mostly attended by high school kids with Fun Cards who cared nothing about rules, and there was nobody to enforce them. Kumba, for example, ran with only two employees&mdash;one at the boarding dock and one in the control room&mdash;with nobody managing the queue to enforce social distancing or face coverings, and I was cut in front of at least once while trying to maintain proper spacing.
