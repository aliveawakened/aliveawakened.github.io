I'm not sure what to make of the last several hours, besides the fact that the United States of America, the premiere nation among nations, for four hours looked like a third-world dictatorship was being overthrown. 

I honestly don't know what to make of anything political these days.

Mainstream and social media have been replete with editorializations in what is supposed to be objective news that allegations of voting fraud were "unsubstantiated", "false", or "fruitless" when the other side claims they have over a thousand sworn affidavits that no court wants to even touch claiming that said fraud exists. In the process we also learned that they actively suppressed or refused to report stories against Democratic candiates or their families (Hunter Biden ring a bell?) because "nobody's interested in it" or it might affect their advertiser's loyalty.

This time around, it's gone even further&mdash;outlets like [Facebook](https://facebook.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com) have chosen to exercise editorial "liberty" over their services by actively suppressing, removing, or otherwise deplatforming anyone who refuses to agree with the "mainstream" view. Last I checked the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (Section 230, to be specific), that is not protected conduct under the law. I should know&mdash;[I was sued once](https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Unpublished/032176.U.pdf) under that law (full disclosure, the case was ultimately dismissed as to me due to lack of personal jurisdiction).

But that's not really the point of this note.

I like to think as an individual that I am educated about the process, that I am somewhat smart and know what I'm doing, that I am well aware that _violent_ protest is never an acceptable solution. But apparently, if you put enough of people like me into a large group, we suddenly lose our intelligence and go on a mob rampage like so many feral apes.

That's also not the point of this note, even thought that's what I've titled it.

If anything, the last several months have shown just how much power those who are the "elite"&mdash;those who have the money and connections and therefore the *real* influence&mdash; have over our society. In the end, they always win. How "We the People" vote in any given election only matters if it's in line with their agenda. When it doesn't, they will find a way to successfully overturn it. Maybe not right away, but eventually it will be. 

After the election of 2020, I've given up on ever voting in any electoral contest ever again. Not because the Democrats or the Republicans won or lost, but because this cycle has exposed everything that is corrupt and self-dealing about government, and not just here in America. I suppose in that context, Trump has been highly successful. They have proven that in the end, your vote doesn't matter. At all. I'm done.

I think [this gal](https://www.theburningplatform.com/2020/11/07/i-am-done/) says it even better.
