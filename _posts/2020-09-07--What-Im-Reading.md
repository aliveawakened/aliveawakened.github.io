## What is this?

I do a _lot_ of reading of RSS/Atom feeds throughout the day. In the past, when I find something interesting, I would post it to my [Facebook](https://facebook.com/stevenwatsonbuehler) page, which I'm sure my friends and family get tired of looking at with the waves of political and geeky articles that are constantly posted.

So, instead of constant article links posting to Facebook, I decided to leverage [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html) and the application I use on my Mac to read these feeds ([NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/)&mdash;yes, it's back) to create a daily feed of the articles I've "starred" to share in one post per day rather than numerous posts through the day.

Following are today's articles. Links will take you directly to the article. I strongly advise that if there is a link to the original when you get there, look at the original source whenever you can.
