"What a long, strange trip it's been" would be somewhat of an understatement describing this past year, wouldn't it? 

There have been a lot of changes since my last annual missive, a significant portion of, but not all of, which have been as a result of the coronavirus pandemic that locked most if not all of us down to our homes since March. I am fortunate enough to be able to perform my job from home full-time in what is considered a "critical" or "essential" industry, so the changes have not been as much of a disruption to my life as I'm sure they have been to many of you, apart from not being able to get out and about as much as I'm used to and face coverings becoming part of my daily outfit when I do venture outside. 

Perhaps the biggest change is that I won't be celebrating New Year's Eve inside Disney World as I have been doing for the past several years. With advance reservations being required and the difficulty in obtaining one as a passholder with the capacity restrictions in place, I decided to cancel my Platinum pass when Disney provided the opportunity. I did purchase a pass for the [Universal Orlando](https://www.universalorlando.com) Resort just a week or so before coronavirus shut everything down, and I spent the downtime reading the _Harry Potter_&trade; books to shore up my knowledge of the Wizarding World&trade; for when things opened up again (which they did in June). For the record, I got sorted into Ravenclaw&trade;.

There have been several other changes as well around these parts. It's my first full year being back in [Plant City](https://www.plantcitygov.com) after being in Tampa for the last several. In late January I traded in the `#doombuggy` ('09 smart fortwo) for a more recent normal-sized car (a 2017 Toyota Yaris liftback) just in time for a promotion and accompanying pay raise at work to kick in and make the payments and insurance affordable. And, most recently, I swapped out the Google Pixel 4 XL for an iPhone and Apple gear again.
