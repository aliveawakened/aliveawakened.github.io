# Personal Informatics Projects

I'm a _huge_ fan of personal informatics (also known as "Quantified Self&trade;", "life hacking", "self-tracking", among many other descriptors). I suppose it goes right with my autistic tendencies to play around with data for fun as well as for a paycheck. It's also a good way to keep track of myself and the changes that happen in my body, my mood, my diet, &c., in ways that I can see patterns that may need changing or take pride in the progress that I make.

## Current Personal Informatics Projects

- **[Where I've Been](/whereivebeen)**  
  Using the [Swarm](https://www.swarmapp.com) and [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) <abbrev name="Application Programming Interface">API</abbrev>s to display the last 250 check-ins I've made in Swarm.

## My Tracking Tools

- **[Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch) Series 3** (originally used a Fitbit until the screen started dying).

- **[Swarm](https://www.swarmapp.com) Mobile App**  
    Swarm was spun off from [Foursquare](https://www.foursquare.com) as a separate app for life-logging and posting checkins to places that I find myself at.

- **My [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone) 11 Pro Max**  
    Specifically, I've created workflows via the out-of-the-box [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055#:~:text=Find%20new%20shortcuts%20in%20the%20Gallery.%201%20On,to%20add.%205%20Tap%20Add%20to%20Siri.%20) app to maintain a "personal log" whenever I do something that I need to track or want to otherwise make a time-stamped entry. Each entry contains a timestamp, my location (as determined by the phone), and whatever text message I provide.  In theory this could replace Swarm for place check-ins, but Swarm is more consistent on locations.

- **[Emacs `org-mode`](https://www.orgmode.org)**  
    I use this extensively at work to track my hours on task, maintain a portable calendar I can easily load onto my other devices, make sortable tables and lists that I can later use as data for tracking, you name it. The `emacs` text editor itself has been around since the 1970s (if it ain't broke, why fix it?).

-   I used to have apps like **Dash** and **Automatic** that use an <abbrev name="On Board Diagnostics">OBD</abbrev> adapter device in my car to track where I drove and my car's performance metrics, but both services have since shut down and the only suitable alternative that I have is for Windows 10 (none of my Windows devices have built-in GPS) and Windows Phone (defunct).
