# An open letter to prospective mates.

First, two things I will <u>not</u> ask for:

1. **Nudes.** I'm sure you have a smoking hot body underneath that attire; but you are a human being, not an object.  You deserve better.

2. **Sex**, until _you_ are comfortable with it. Again, you are a human being and not a f*ck toy. That means _you_ get to make the first move, which I realize goes against a lot of popular relationship advice.  There's also something about having an established relationship that makes it so much better.

Now that we've gotten those items out of the way, you probably want to know more about me. I put together this web site for that purpose, although in a more general way; I had no plans to use these pages as a dating profile when I wrote them. So I keep it simple.

* I'm the kind of fully grown nerd who shows up at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando every Sunday evening in full wizarding attire, complete with robe, wand, and Premiere pass. BTW, I'm a Ravenclaw, and I _ROCK_ the robe. I've basically spent enough that I've committed to this as my Halloween costume for at least the next decade.

* I'm an Aspie (high-functioning autistic), which means I may do and/or say wierd stuff that doesn't sink in that I have said/done it until I have already fully embarassed myself in doing so. It also means my sense of humor is a little&mdash;how shall I put this&mdash;warped. I was physically and verbally bullied daily from the second grade all the way through high school because of it, so I'm still a kid trapped in a late-40-something body.

* I may have a lot of book smarts, but I can make anyone laugh at my glorious lack of social and relationship skills.  I am a _far_ better writer, I'm told.

* My last name is the target of many a Ben Stein-voiced deadpan joke related to a [certain 1980s movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller's_Day_Off). I have accepted this fate. 

* I am INSPIRED by:
  - Fantasy and Magic (see Harry Potter notes above).
  - Space and Technology. I have an annual pass to the Kennedy Space Center so I can watch launches on site and not on TV (or YouTube).
  - Faith. My college degree is in pastoral minsitry.
  - Beauty. Simple things.

* I am TURNED OFF by:
  - Complaining. If it's something you are able to change, do it or shut up. If you can't do anything about it, it's not worth complaining about.
  - Smoking. My mother and grandfather both died from it, and I can't stand the smell (or the taste of kissing an ashtray).
  - Self-important or proud people. I have won and lost enough in my life that I consider myself extremely blessed and humbled to be where I am and have what I have right now. 

I'm sure there's more that you'd like to know. I'm an open book; always have been. In fact, [here's my info](/contact) up front. (Note: My phone does not ring if the number isn't already in my contact/address book, as an anti-spam/robocall measure. You'll have to leave a message at least the first time.)
