> Yep, that's me. You're probably wondering what the hell I'm doing here&hellip;

I'm 48, going on 12. I'm high-functioning autistic, which means a _glorious lack of social and interpersonal skills_. But I can write words. And music. And code. I'm addicted to theme parks and roller coasters, and _sorta_ hooked on "Harry Potter" (the books, not the films; I can't sit through movies).

I originally went to college for a Bachelor's degree in religion, with emphasis in pastoral ministry, which I did get. I was supposed to be a preacher. Happily married with kids, teaching and preaching. But life didn't happen that way.

Instead, I'm divorced, widowed (yes, both&mdash;I remarried after the divorce), and living on my own in a small apartment in Plant City, Florida, where I never really intended to end up. But the town has grown on me, and you grow where you've been planted. I fully expect to be alone for the rest of the life I have left (don't mourn; I've accepted my fate).

I have a full-time job managing and reporting on data for a national workers' comp PBM, and I work from home.

Needless to say, I don't get out very often. When I do, it's to a theme park&mdash;[Universal Orlando](https://universalorlando.com), [SeaWorld](https://www.seaworld.com/orlando), or [Busch Gardens](https://buschgardens.com/tampa) (I let my [Disney World](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com) pass expire during the COVID-related shutdown).

I did a [ton of music](https://soundcloud.com/inmysilence) during the '90s, and served in a couple of churches back home in Southern California as a musician and worship leader. That ended when I moved to Florida in 2000. 

After my second wife died suddenly in 2016 (she was also my crush in junior high school), I took to livestreaming video games as a means of combatting the boredom and loneliness that ensued. The channels never really took off, but I still [livestream](https://twitch.tv/stevenwbuehler) on a somewhat irregular basis. 

So that's the "TL;DR" version. Eventually I'll come around to a longer one. My [email box](mailto:stevenwbuehler@icloud.com) is open.
