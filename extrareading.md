If your "deep study" of scripture involves nothing more than a _Strong's Concordance_ and a commentary or two, I'd suggest you're doing it wrong unless all you're writing is a devotional. 

Not that there's anything wrong with Strong's (I use it a lot myself) or most commentaries, but it fails to offer the in-depth perspective of the culture and times of the people who _first heard_ these verses read to them in their assemblies and synagogues centuries ago.  We have to remember that a lot changes over time&mdash;the ways we do things, technology, how we perceive the world can be very different over nearly two thousand years. Fortunately, the base message of scripture remains miraculously unchanged.

To the end of helping others find resources that can provide deeper insight into Scripture and its original composition I've provided below a list of texts that I've used during the course of my own study (both during my academic days and beyond) that were incredibly useful to me. Many of these may be out of print; most of them are now available as modules to digital study systems like the famous Logos family.

- Gerhard Kittel, et al., _Theological Dictionary of the New Testament_ (10 vols.). Eerdmans. More commonly called simply the "TDNT", this is perhaps the single most used and most valuable resource in any student's library when studying the Greek New Testament.
- Helmer Ringgen, et al., _Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament_ (16 vols.). Eerdmans, 2018. Accompanies the above TDNT for Hebrew study.
- _The Complete Biblical Library_. Word Library Press. This was originally produced as a 16-volume bound set of the New Testament that serves as a starting-off point for in-depth biblical study. On the left page, a complete Greek-English interlinear with details of differences between historical manuscripts, fully keyed to an accompanying six-volume Greek lexicon. On the right page, a verse-by-verse commentary and comparison of how phrases read among different Bible translations (including, if you were to read only the bold text, the entire King James Version). Of particular note in the lexicon, each entry includes volume and page from the "big five" resources of Biblical criticism (including Kittel's TDNT above, Strong's, and multiple others). A few years later a Hebrew Old Testament set in the same format was also produced, with the entries from the New Testament Lexicon already keyed to their Hebrew equivalents in the Old Testament set.  The product is long out of print, but some Christian college and university libraries still have it.
