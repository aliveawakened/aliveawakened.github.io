# Colophon

<img src="/images/colophon.png" style="text-align: center" />

I was inspired by [John Saddington's](https://john.do/colophon) and a post from [Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/) to create this "Colophon" for this site and also for my life&mdash;the tools and systems that I use in my everyday life.

A colophon in the book world is a section usually in the forematter that describes how the book was created, printed, and published. You may find them often in high school or college yearbooks (my [college _alma mater_](https://www.vanguard.edu) was small enough at the time to publish a yearbook every academic year).  Usually included are details about the typefaces used, the kind of paper it was printed on, how many pages and copies were produced, how it's bound. 

## This Site

This site is maintained in [Github Pages](https://github.io) using a customized edition of Samarjeet Singh's [Texture](https://github.com/samarsault/texture) theme, said customizations being replacing his built-in [Fontello](https://www.fontello.com)-created icon font with the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) library so I can use more icons than what was provided in his CSS.

I live and work in a rather small one-bedroom junior apartment (~450 square feet, including the living/work room, bedroom, and kitchen area). The small size is intentional&mdash;it's easier to keep clean (although cleanliness is not one of my autistic features). My workspace is pretty simple: four [Linnmon/Adils](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/linnmon-adils-table-white-s29932181/) white tables from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com) wrapped around a corner of the living/work room (what I usually call my "work area"), a file cabinet, a document shredder, and the geeky gear, which looks something like this (this doesn't include my work laptop, which is provided by my employer for work):

My primary desktop machine is a [IBuyPower Slate 9000W Desktop PC](https://www.walmart.com/ip/iBUYPOWER-Gaming-Desktop-PC-SLATE9000W-Intel-Core-i7-9700F-16GB-DDR4-2666Memory-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660Ti-240GB-SSD-1TB-HDD-RGB-Windows-10-Home-64-Bi/436132832?irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_TfeWSky9WxyOUjZwUx0Mo38WUkiWK0WONWPdRk0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_2003851&clickid=TfeWSky9WxyOUjZwUx0Mo38WUkiWK0WONWPdRk0&sharedid=) gaming PC with an [Intel&reg; Core&trade; i7-9700F](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/193738/intel-core-i7-9700f-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz.html) CPU (8 cores @ 3.0 GHz), [Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/gtx-1660-ti/?ncid=afm-chs-44270&ranMID=44270&ranEAID=msYS1Nvjv4c&ranSiteID=msYS1Nvjv4c-CzLVf.aGYJo9CuWTu9e7bA) GPU, 16 GB RAM, and two hard drives (a two-terabyte [SanDisk Ultra 3D SSD](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/sandisk-ultra-3d-sata-iii-ssd?afsrc=1&cjevent=e9e090bdd42411ea800a00510a1c0e14&utm_medium=afl1#SDSSDH3-250G-G25) and a four-terabyte Seagate mechanical hard disk).

Also in the work area is a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org) Linux microserver w/ 4 GB RAM and a 128 GB SDXC card installed as disk space. I use it for a lot of webhook handling and automatic publishing.

The peripherals include Logitech's [MX Keys](https://www.logitech.com/mxkeys) and [M720 Triathon](https://www.logitech.com/m720) multi-device keyboard and mouse combo that can be easily switched between my desktop, work laptop, and Raspberry Pi. It all shows up on an [ASUS VS278Q-P](https://www.asus.com/us/Commercial-Monitors/VS278QP/) 27&Prime; 1920 &times; 1080 LCD Display w/ two HDMI inputs, a VGA D-SUB input, and a DisplayPort input&mdash;enough for everything.  I used to be a two-screen freak but have grown to prefer keeping things simple with one wide screen so I can focus on what's in front of me (when I'm working I'll use the work laptop as a second screen where I usually keep Outlook open and waiting for email).
  
## On the Go

My mobile bag is a [LowePro Streamline 150](https://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-LP36589-PWW-StreamLine-Camera-Slate/dp/B00D6631W4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lowepro+streamline+150&qid=1596307458&sr=8-1) _camera_ bag that happens to fit the stuff I usually need when I'm outside. 

<img align="right" src="https://stevenbuehler.github.io/images/lenovo-tablet-yogabook-c930-hero-1126.png" width="250">My mobile machine is a _much smaller_ [Lenovo Yoga Book C930](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-900-series/Yoga-Book-C930/p/ZZIWZWBYB1J) dual-display notebook (not to be confused with their [Yoga C930](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-900-series/Yoga-C930-13IKB-Glass/p/88YGC900983) full-sized 2-in-1 laptop). The regular screen is a 10.8&Prime; 2560 &times; 1600 QHD IPS touchscreen; the _second_ screen is a 10.8&Prime; 1920 &times; 1080 e-Ink Mobius&trade; touchscreen that functions as a flat "halo" keyboard, drawing and notetaking surface (with accompanying Lenovo Precision Pen), e-book reader (ePubs, PDFs, and `.mobi` Kindle files), and (in a pinch) as a second or main display when I want to save battery. Unlike most 2-in-1s this size, it runs a 1.2 Ghz Intel Core i5 dual-core CPU that turbo boosts to 3.2 GHz and sports a 128 GB PCIe SSD. It uses a watchband hinge to flex 360&deg; and is only a millimeter or two larger than an iPad when it's folded up and an ounce or two heavier.

In my mobile bag I pack the Yoga Book with its Precision Pen, a couple of USB-C cables, an 20,000 mAh [Anker PowerCore Metro](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-metro-20000-pd/A1281H11-1) power bank, and the Yoga Book's power brick (which is a USB-C wall plug not uncommonly used on tablets).

And, in this age of COVID-19, I keep a few [masks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCpEgFJpEah/) and a pair of [cooling gaiters](https://mission.com) handy.

My mobile device is a [Google Pixel 4 XL](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4_specs). I don't even use my regular point-and-shoot camera anymore&mdash;the pictures from this phone are _that_ good.

I also have an [Acer Chromebook Spin 11](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CP311-1H-C5PN-Convertible-Celeron/dp/B07G4CWK1D) available for mobile use that I bought as an update to my existing Chromebook several months before I discovered Lenovo's Yoga Book. While it also flexes into a tablet and sports a Wacom touchscreen with pen input capability and a full keyboard that's easier to type on that the Yoga Book's flat one, and it automatically connects to my Pixel for mobile data, it's bulkier and heavier than the Yoga Book, so it often ends up with me when I want to compute with Linux in bed and much less rarely in my geek bag when I leave the apartment.

I can print quick notes from my Pixel to a smaller-than-palm-sized, battery-powered generic 58mm (2&frac14;&Prime;) wide thermal [receipt/POS printer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VXPLLMQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details) I bought online that has Bluetooth&trade; and USB connections. Saves me the effort of having contact cards printed up when I can quickly print information and/or a QR code on the fly using [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loopedlabs.escposprintservice).

To store a lot of electronic documents on the go, I have a 32 GB [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXG6C9W) e-reader. I also send a lot of converted web pages and ePubs that I want to look at later (like in bed before I go to sleep). I use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) software to convert from other formats to Kindle's native format. Why a separate e-reader when there's already one in the Yoga Book? Because the Yoga Book's e-reader _sucks_. s

I drove a [Smart fortwo Passion](https://www.smart.com) until early in 2020, when I traded it in for a basic 2017 [Toyota Yaris](https://toyota.com/yaris) liftback. Before being in cars I was riding motor scooters year-round (even in the Florida summer storm weather) starting with a 50 cc Yamaha Zuma and then moving up to a Yamaha Vino 125 and finally a Suzuki Burgman 400 until a few wipe-outs convinced me it was time to find something safer.

## Software, Services

I use a combination of [Microsoft 365](https://www.office365.com) and [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com) to get things done, and I use [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com) a _lot_ to automate processes and create front-ends to various APIs like [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) and other Google services to automate and log data because I can use hourly time triggers to keep their tokens refreshed. I like Excel for its Power Query features, although I could roughly do the same with a combination of Google Sheets and Apps Script. 

I mentioned that I use a Raspberry Pi 4B to automate a lot of things; among them:

- Retrieving RSS feeds and pushing them to an "RSS" label in my Gmail account every hour.

- Regularly pulling data from various APIs for whatever data projects I'm working on (including the COVID-19 charts I've been publishing to Twitter every day) using the Raspberry Pi version of [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolframresearch.com).

- Compiling daily digests of my schedule ([gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli)), finances ([ledger](https://ledger-cli.org) simple-as-text-file double-entry accounting), and other stuff.

I keep a [memobird](https://www.mymemobird.com) wireless thermal printer on my desk as well to receive printed copies of automated messages and such so I don't forget things. I learned the [API](http://api.memobird.cn) so I can fashion my own material rather than use their [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.memobird.usapp) (which is limited).

I use [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) and [AutoApps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoappshub) on my Pixel to do a lot of custom stuff too.

Desktop apps:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for text, code, and blog editing.

- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) for web browsing, although I like [Microsoft Edge](https://edge.microsoft.com) better but have to keep things synced with my Pixel.

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) for vector graphics.

- [Acoustica Mixcraft Pro Studio](https://acoustica.com/) for music creation.

- [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) as an X-Server when I'm remotely accessing the Raspberry Pi or my desktop's <abbrev title="Windows Services for Linux">WSL</a>2 instance.

- [Gnome Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) to connect to Gmail/Contacts/Calendar when I need to organize/clean stuff up.

- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolframresearch.com) on the Raspberry Pi for fancy charts and analyses, when I'm not using Google Sheets or Excel.

- [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) for most of my notetaking.

## Analog Tools

As I get older I find there is still a place for analog (as in paper and pen or pencil) tools, because it is often much easier to quickly grab a sheet of paper or a notebook than to wake up a machine and stylus. It's also been repeatedly proven that things that are _written down by hand_ are better retained. Even then, everything that starts on a piece of paper is ultimately scanned and OCR'd for future searchability.

I've found Norcom's [Exceed](http://www.norcominc.com/brands/products.php?brand=2) journals to be every bit as good as the [Moleskines](https://www.moleskine.com) and [Rhodias](https://rhodiapads.com/) and [Leuctturms](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/) of the world for a _whole lot less money_ and _easier availability_ (Walmart sells 'em). My absolute favorite paper product to write on is [stone paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_paper), but it's increasingly more difficult to find outside of the very fancy writing shops (and it's pricey).

My preferred writing tools are Zebra's [M-301 mechanical pencils](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/m-301-mechanical-pencil/) and [F-301 ballpoint pens](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-301-ball-point-retractable/), but I've also fallen for Paper Mate's [Ink Joy Gel](https://www.papermate.com/pens/gel/inkjoy-gel-retractable) pens. For a while I was using a [LiveScribe](https://www.livescribe.com) digital pen, which while providing the convenience of both hard copy and immediate digital capture, also meant I had to charge my pen often. Once capture apps like [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html) and [Office Lens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/office-lens/9wzdncrfj3t8) became suitable for capturing all that paper, there was no need for digital pens anymore (plus the notebooks are _pricey!_).

Most of the time I scan all my paper things in with my Brother [DSmobile 920DW](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/ds920dw) portable scanner, which scans to either PC or SD card, and then use a USB-C reader and Adobe Scan to convert it all and upload to archive as searchable PDFs.
