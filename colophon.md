# Colophon

<img src="/images/colophon.png" style="text-align: center" />

I was inspired by [John Saddington's](https://john.do/colophon) and a post from [Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/) to create this "Colophon" for this site and also for my life&mdash;the tools and systems that I use in my everyday life.

A colophon in the book world is a section usually in the forematter that describes how the book was created, printed, and published. You may find them often your high school or college yearbooks (my [college _alma mater_](https://www.vanguard.edu) was small enough at the time to publish a yearbook every academic year).  Usually included are details about the typefaces used, the kind of paper it was printed on, how many pages and copies were produced, how it's bound. 

## This Site

This site is maintained in [Github Pages](https://github.io) using a customized edition of Samarjeet Singh's [Texture](https://github.com/samarsault/texture) theme, said customizations being replacing his built-in [Fontello](https://www.fontello.com)-created icon font with the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) library so I can use more icons than what was provided in his CSS. 

## The Workspace

I live and work in a rather small one-bedroom junior apartment (~450 square feet, including the living/work room, bedroom, and kitchen area). The small size is intentional&mdash;it's easier to keep clean (although cleanliness is not one of my autistic features). My workspace is pretty simple: four [Linnmon/Adils](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/linnmon-adils-table-white-s29932181/) white tables from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com) wrapped around a corner of the living/work room (what I usually call my "work area"), a file cabinet, a document shredder, and the geeky gear, which looks something like this (this doesn't include my work laptop, which is provided by my employer for work):

My primary desktop machine is a [IBuyPower Slate 9000W Desktop PC](https://www.walmart.com/ip/iBUYPOWER-Gaming-Desktop-PC-SLATE9000W-Intel-Core-i7-9700F-16GB-DDR4-2666Memory-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660Ti-240GB-SSD-1TB-HDD-RGB-Windows-10-Home-64-Bi/436132832?irgwc=1&sourceid=imp_TfeWSky9WxyOUjZwUx0Mo38WUkiWK0WONWPdRk0&veh=aff&wmlspartner=imp_2003851&clickid=TfeWSky9WxyOUjZwUx0Mo38WUkiWK0WONWPdRk0&sharedid=) gaming PC with an [Intel&reg; Core&trade; i7-9700F](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/193738/intel-core-i7-9700f-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz.html) CPU (8 cores @ 3.0 GHz), [Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/gtx-1660-ti/?ncid=afm-chs-44270&ranMID=44270&ranEAID=msYS1Nvjv4c&ranSiteID=msYS1Nvjv4c-CzLVf.aGYJo9CuWTu9e7bA) GPU, 16 GB RAM, and two hard drives (a two-terabyte [SanDisk Ultra 3D SSD](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/sandisk-ultra-3d-sata-iii-ssd?afsrc=1&cjevent=e9e090bdd42411ea800a00510a1c0e14&utm_medium=afl1#SDSSDH3-250G-G25) and a four-terabyte Seagate mechanical hard disk).

Also in the work area is a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org) Linux microserver w/ 4 GB RAM and a 128 GB SDXC card installed as disk space. I use it for a lot of webhook handling and automatic publishing.

The peripherals include Logitech's [MX Keys](https://www.logitech.com/mxkeys) and [M720 Triathon](https://www.logitech.com/m720) multi-device keyboard and mouse combo that can be easily switched between my desktop, work laptop, and Raspberry Pi. It all shows up on an [ASUS VS278Q-P](https://www.asus.com/us/Commercial-Monitors/VS278QP/) 27&Prime; 1920 &times; 1080 LCD Display w/ two HDMI inputs, a VGA D-SUB input, and a DisplayPort input&mdash;enough for everything.  I used to be a two-screen freak but have grown to prefer keeping things simple with one wide screen so I can focus on what's in front of me (when I'm working I'll use the work laptop as a second screen where I usually keep Outlook open and waiting for email).
  
## On the Go

My mobile bag is a [LowePro Streamline 150](https://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-LP36589-PWW-StreamLine-Camera-Slate/dp/B00D6631W4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lowepro+streamline+150&qid=1596307458&sr=8-1) _camera_ bag that happens to fit the stuff I usually need when I'm outside. 

<img align="right" src="https://stevenbuehler.github.io/images/lenovo-tablet-yogabook-c930-hero-1126.png" width="250">My mobile machine is a _much smaller_ [Lenovo Yoga Book C930](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-900-series/Yoga-Book-C930/p/ZZIWZWBYB1J) dual-display notebook (not to be confused with their [Yoga C930](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-900-series/Yoga-C930-13IKB-Glass/p/88YGC900983) full-sized 2-in-1 laptop). The regular screen is a 10.8&Prime; 2560 &times; 1600 QHD IPS touchscreen; the _second_ screen is a 10.8&Prime; 1920 &times; 1080 e-Ink Mobius&trade; touchscreen that functions as a flat "halo" keyboard, drawing and notetaking surface (with accompanying Lenovo Precision Pen), e-book reader (ePubs, PDFs, and `.mobi` Kindle files), and (in a pinch) as a second or main display when I want to save battery. Unlike most 2-in-1s this size, it runs a 1.2 Ghz Intel Core i5 dual-core CPU that turbo boosts to 3.2 GHz and sports a 128 GB PCIe SSD. It uses a watchband hinge to flex 360&deg; and is only a millimeter or two larger than an iPad when it's folded up and an ounce or two heavier.

In my mobile bag I pack the Yoga Book with its Precision Pen, a couple of USB-C cables, an 20,000 mAh [Anker PowerCore Metro](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-metro-20000-pd/A1281H11-1) power bank, and the Yoga Book's power brick (which is a USB-C wall plug not uncommonly used on tablets).

And, in this age of COVID-19, I keep a few [masks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCpEgFJpEah/) and a pair of [cooling gaiters](https://mission.com) handy.

My mobile device is a [Google Pixel 4 XL](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4_specs). I don't even use my regular point-and-shoot camera anymore&mdash;the pictures from this phone are _that_ good.

I can print quick notes from my Pixel to a smaller-than-palm-sized, battery-powered generic 58mm (2&frac14;&Prime;) wide thermal [receipt/POS printer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06VXPLLMQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details) I bought online that has Bluetooth&trade; and USB connections. Saves me the effort of having contact cards printed up when I can quickly print information and/or a QR code on the fly using [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loopedlabs.escposprintservice).

I drove a [Smart fortwo Passion](https://www.smart.com) until early in 2020, when I traded it in for a basic 2017 [Toyota Yaris](https://toyota.com/yaris) liftback. Before being in cars I was riding motor scooters year-round (even in the Florida summer storm weather) starting with a 50 cc Yamaha Zuma and then moving up to a Yamaha Vino 125 and finally a Suzuki Burgman 400 until a few wipe-outs convinced me it was time to find something safer.

## Software, Services

I use a combination of [Microsoft 365](https://www.office365.com) and [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com) to get things done, and I use [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com) a _lot_ to automate processes and create front-ends to various APIs like [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) and other Google services to automate and log data because I can use hourly time triggers to keep their tokens refreshed. I like Excel for its Power Query features, although I could roughly do the same with a combination of Google Sheets and Apps Script. 

I mentioned that I use a Raspberry Pi 4B to automate a lot of things; among them:

- Retrieving RSS feeds and pushing them to an "RSS" label in my Gmail account every hour.

- Regularly pulling data from various APIs for whatever data projects I'm working on (including the COVID-19 charts I've been publishing to Twitter every day) using the Raspberry Pi version of [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolframresearch.com).

- Compiling daily digests of my schedule ([gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli)), finances ([ledger](https://ledger-cli.org) simple-as-text-file double-entry accounting), and other stuff.

I keep a [memobird](https://www.mymemobird.com) wireless thermal printer on my desk as well to receive printed copies of automated messages and such so I don't forget things. I learned the [API](http://api.memobird.cn) so I can fashion my own material rather than use their [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.memobird.usapp) (which is limited).

I use [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) and [AutoApps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoappshub) on my Pixel to do a lot of custom stuff too.

## Analog Tools

As I get older I find there is still a place for analog (as in paper and pen or pencil) tools, because it is often much easier to quickly grab a sheet of paper or a notebook than to wake up a machine and stylus. It's also been repeatedly proven that things that are _written down by hand_ are better retained. Even then, everything that starts on a piece of paper is ultimately scanned and OCR'd for future searchability.

I've found Norcom's [Exceed](http://www.norcominc.com/brands/products.php?brand=2) journals to be every bit as good as the [Moleskines](https://www.moleskine.com) and [Rhodias](https://rhodiapads.com/) and [Leuctturms](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/) of the world for a _whole lot less money_ and _easier availability_ (Walmart sells 'em). My absolute favorite paper product to write on is [stone paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_paper), but it's increasingly more difficult to find outside of the very fancy writing shops (and it's pricey).

My preferred writing tools are Zebra's [M-301 mechanical pencils](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/m-301-mechanical-pencil/) and [F-301 ballpoint pens](https://www.zebrapen.com/product/f-301-ball-point-retractable/), but I've also fallen for Paper Mate's [Ink Joy Gel](https://www.papermate.com/pens/gel/inkjoy-gel-retractable) pens. For a while I was using a [LiveScribe](https://www.livescribe.com) digital pen, which while providing the convenience of both hard copy and immediate digital capture, also meant I had to charge my pen often. Once capture apps like [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html) and [Office Lens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/office-lens/9wzdncrfj3t8) became suitable for capturing all that paper, there was no need for digital pens anymore (plus the notebooks are _pricey!_).

Most of the time I scan all my paper things in with my Brother [DSmobile 920DW](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/ds920dw) portable scanner, which scans to either PC or SD card, and then use a USB-C reader and Adobe Scan to convert it all and upload to archive as searchable PDFs.
