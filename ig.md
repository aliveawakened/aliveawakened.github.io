# Hey there, new InstaFriend!

After participating in recent events such as [Tony Robbins](https://tonyrobbins.com)' "New World, New You Challenge" and getting outside a lot more to my favorite places like the theme parks and [KSC](https://kennedyspacecenter.com) and being recognized a bit more, it's resulting in new followers to my social media outlets.

I wanted to take a few moments of your time just to let you know what you're getting into, and what my "rules" are on whom I follow back, so that there are no misunderstandings down the line.

Obviously I can't follow everybody or my feeds would become unmanageable, so some time ago I established a "baseline" for whom I choose to follow, or whom I follow back when others choose to follow my life.

First of all, I live my life rather openly online, for a number of reasons. First, it kills the rumor mill, because people know they can approach me any time and in a way it puts me in control of my own online destiny. I also do it in hopes that maybe something I share online can be of help to others that may have similar conditions or life situations as my own.

Almost all of my contact information is on my [Contact](/contact) page, except my home address; but I usually provide even that to those who ask and have a legitimate purpose (eventually I'll break down and rent a P.O. Box, but I don't see the need to yet). All of the social media outlets I use most often are listed there, too. Even my phone number, but understand that if you're not already in my contacts, it'll go straight to voicemail and my phone will not even ring; and if you don't leave a message beyond a mere "hi it's so-and-so; call me back", I'll assume you/it are not important enough to call back. 

## Who I am/am not.

I'm not a "Tony Robbins wannabe" lifestyle/peak performance/marketing guru or consultant. I don't do seminars or public speaking except for the occasional invitation that I get maybe once every few years to talk about sexual addiction and recovery, or provide a testimony at a [Celebrate Recovery](https://celebraterecovery.com)&reg; event or meeting. I have ministry training and a B.A. in religion with emphasis in pastoral ministry, but the degree's never been put to any serious use and I've been behind a pulpit a total of twice in my entire life.

I am _definitely_ not a relationship consultant, given I'm "0 for 2" in that department (both divorced _and_ widowed). I can probably tell you what _doesn't_ work, if that helps.

I just an "average Joe" with Asperger Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Arrested Development Disorder, with a warped sense of humor, living life with what I've been given and sharing with others a peek into that life. My [About](/about) page can tell you more random stuff.

I have a regular 8-to-4 work-from-home job as a data and reporting specialist with a group of workers' compensation settlement and Medicare Set-Aside consultants. It keeps a roof over my head and food on the table, with enough left over to do the things I enjoy. 

## Whom I _don't_ follow

I generally don't care who follows my social media unless it's an obvious bot or sales gimmick. 

If you're clearly trying to sell me something, expect not a follow, but a block (and probably the filing of a spam report).

If your social media consists almost entirely of quotes, slogans, bumper stickers, or reposts of others' content, and nothing that tells me about _you as a human being_, don't expect a follow. 

I want to know _you_, not your product.

If your social media feeds are not in English, don't expect a follow (unless you're really cute; then I might make an exception, but I won't understand a word you're posting). 

I don't feed trolls. If that's your purpose, don't bother. I will most likely correct your grammar like the Grammar Nazi&trade; I am and then move on.
